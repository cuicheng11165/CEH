1. WEP is an extremely weak encryption method that is defined in the 802.11b standard
2. WPA, which was designed to address weaknesses in Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), only adheres to a subset of the 802.11i standard.
3. Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) adheres to the entire Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11i standard

## Wireless Encryption ##

### WEP ###
It uses 24-bit initialization vector (IV) to create a stream cipher RC4 with Cyclic Redundant Check (CRC) to ensure 
confidentiality and integrity. 

Standard 64-bit WEP uses the 40-bit key,
 128-bit WEP uses 104-bit key and
 256-bit WEP uses a 232-bit key. 


### WPA ###
Wifi Protected Access 

### WPA2 ###
to replace WPA


Encryption | Encryption Algorithm | IV size | Encryption Key | Integraity check mechanism 
-|-|-|-|-
WEP | RC4 | 24 bits | 40/104-bits | CRC-32
WPA | RC4,TKIP| 48 bits | 128bits | MICHAEL ALGORITHM CRC32
WPA2 | AES,CCMP | 48 bits | 128bits | CBC-MAC


## Bluetooth Hacking ##

- Bluesmacking   	dos attack for bluetooth
- BlueBugging		exploits bluetooth to comromise its security
- Bluejack 		send unsolicited message
- BluePrinting	extract infomation of device
- BlueSnarfing	theft infomation from device
- Bluesniffing is the collecting of technical data on a Bluetooth device for hacking purposes
