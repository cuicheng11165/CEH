## attack ##

1. replay attack
2. SYN attack
3. cloning
4. teardrop attack	overlapping IP fragment
5. slowloris attack
6. freak 		Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys 
7. Shink wrap code attack
8. Smurf 		ICMP
9. Fraggle 		UDP
10.  APT	(Advanced,Persistent,Threat)
11. Sybil attack	an attacker works with multiple forged identities to create a strong illusion of traffic congestion, effecting communication between neighboring nodes and networks
12.  forbidden attack is a type of man-in-the-middle attack using hijacked HTTPS sessions. It seeks to exploit reusing the cryptographic nonce used during the TLS handshake
13. Compression Ratio Info-Leak Made Easy (CRIME) is a client-side attacker that looks to exploit the vulnerabilities present in the data compression features of protocols such as SSL/TLS, SPDY, and HTTPS
14. RST hijacking
15. DNS Amplification
16. An attacker performing a watering hole attack would specifically seek to determine the sites that their target visits on an average day. From this list, they would investigate the most vulnerable and inject malicious code into the user interaction portions. Then the attacker would wait for the victim to fall into the trap, in order to use them to perform malicious act
17.A key reinstallation attack (KRACK) seeks to exploit the four-way handshake process used to join the network and generate the fresh encryption key used to encrypt network traffic

DOS & DDOS
1. Volumetric Attack
2. Fragmentation Attack
3. TCP-State-Exhaustion Attack
4. Application layer attack

5. Bandwidth Attack
6. Service Request Flood
7. Syn Attack/ Flood
8. ICMP Flood Attack
9. Peer to Peer Attack		In this attack, clients of a peer-to-peer file-sharing hub are disconnected and directed to connect with the target system
10. Permanent Denial-of-Service Attack   (PDOS) 毁坏硬件
11. Application Level flood attacks
12. Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS)
